    <h1>Test Flexbox use in Tea of the Month section</h1>
    <p>This and the linked-to .css file were written to test the behaviour required for the 'Tea of the Month' [TotM] section of Codecademy's Tea Cozy OPP. The files are based on the principle of smallest-possible-code-required.</p>
    <p>I was getting tangled up in trying to make the section work based on inadequate remembering/understanding of Flexbox properties and the ideas behind them. Building this out and testing in the browser one step at a time allowed me to grok what was needed as well as the concepts. </p>
    <p>The redline for the project shows the TotM section with two rows, three items in the first row and two in the second. Although <code><span class="css-property">flexwrap</span>: <span class="css-value"> wrap</span></code> isn't specified it is plainly what was intended.</p>
