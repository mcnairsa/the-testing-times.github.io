    <h1>Landing Page</h1>
    <p>For now this is a landing page.</p>
    <p>Later it will be the entry point into a multi-layered labaryinth of thoughts, confusions and finding-the-way-out-of-confusions.</p>
    <p>Next step is to work out a describe/it [verb] it [verb] format for html.</p>
    <p>E.g.: describe: Tea of the Month section; it: wraps items from a single columm [or two columns] to all five items on one row.</p>
